Java 8 project that are part of the java.time package, such as LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime, Period, Duration and their supported APIs.
Not thread safe : Unlike old java.util.Date which is not thread safe the new date-time API is immutable and doesnâ€™t have setter methods.
Less operations : In old API there are only few date operations but the new API provides us with many date operations.

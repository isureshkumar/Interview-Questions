1. How to call one microservice from another microservice in spring boot?
Note that we are using RestTemplate to make a REST API call to department-service:
        ResponseEntity<DepartmentDto> responseEntity = restTemplate
                .getForEntity("http://localhost:8080/api/departments/" + user.getDepartmentId(),
                DepartmentDto.class);
